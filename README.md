# API Commentnow
This is an API made for the Seminar - Software Workshop class. This project was developed by a team of five people led by me. This API was made for a simple social network that any user could use from their web browser.
## Description

This API was built with JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js. Just as the MongoDB services were used to be able to store information about the users and the publications that are made in the application. To test this API, the Thunder Client extension was used to test calls to the API.

The API is connected to a web application of the same name, called CommentNow. What can be done in this web application is to create a user, make publications and modify their user profile. Here is the repository of the web application made with React:
This mobile application has to be connected to an API that was made by this same team in order to store and collect data and information from the MySQL database running locally. A similar application was also made for the store clerk, in which he or she could add new products, replenish inventory, and delete or modify items on sale.
